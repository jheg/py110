PROBLEM: Leftover Blocks

You have a number of building blocks that can be used to build a valid 
structure. There are certain rules about what determines a valid structure:

- The building blocks areÂ [cubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube).
- The structure is built in layers.
- The top layer is a single block.
- A block in an upper layer must be supported by four blocks in a lower layer.
- A block in a lower layer can support more than one block in an upper layer.
- You cannot leave gaps between blocks.

Write a program that, given the number of available blocks, calculates the 
number of blocks left over after building the tallest possible valid structure.
